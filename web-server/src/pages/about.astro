                <p>
                    The data is collected from the wikimedia dumps at:
                    <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/">
                        https://dumps.wikimedia.org/
                    </a> or one of their mirrors. The dumps appear to be updated
                    every month at the 20th and the first.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I hope to update this page monthly. It's likely that the
                    results are slightly out of date for some pages though.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I expect to opensource this as soon as I get the backend to
                    look presentable/understandable

            <p>
                Im trying to improve the accessibility of this website and make
                it mostly usable even without javascript. If you find something
                which works suboptimal please don't hesitate to inform me.

            <p>
                The frontend is built using <a href="https://astro.build/">
                    AstroJS
                </a> and is mostly static. For the interactive parts <a
                    href="https://www.solidjs.com/">
                    SolidJS
                </a> is used. The (network) graph visualizations use <a
                    href="https://www.sigmajs.org/">
                    Sigma.js
                </a> in the background.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finding the shortest path at <a href="/wiki/path">
                    shortest path
                </a> works using a bidirectional breadth first search. In comparison
                to a normal bfs this drastically improves performance. Credits <a

                </a> for this idea.
